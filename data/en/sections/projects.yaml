  summary: >
    This project developed a module which is used to read the temperature object by measuring its infrared radiation. The HW of the module is based on a SOC and the programming languanges are C and Python.
    
    
    Higher accuracy with broader range driving by well designed algorithm.
    
    
    Costing down with latest SOC chip.
    
    
    Flexable production line with new designed calibration solution. 
    
    
    Easy to learn with plent of examples.

  summary: >
    A frequency response analyzer measures the gain and phase response characteristics with respect to frequency of the device or system under test, by applying a frequency swept sine wave to it and examining its response signal.
    
    
    As our customer faced the difficulty that the network was too noisy to be tested, we developed the analyzer to help them. The analyzer is a virtual instrument. The hardware is the computer peripheral developed with STM32F407 and the rest is a desktop app running on computer developed with python.
    
    
    Out analyzer has higher accuracy and sensitivity than common analyzer, such as Bode100.
